# **The Beginning of My Journey to Becoming a Software Engineer**

This repository contains the first results of the project tasks related to my learning of Git and GitHub.

In this project, I started by learning the basics of Git and GitHub.

_However, there were some prerequisites:_

* A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. git), describing what this project is about
* Do not use GitHub's web UI, but the command line to perform the exercise (except for operations that can not possibly be done any other way than through the web UI). You won't be able to perform many of the task requirements on the web UI, and you should start getting used to the command line for simple tasks because many complex tasks can only be done via the command line.
* Your answer files should only contain the command, and nothing else




### **Task 0**
* **Create and setup your Git and GitHub account**

**Step 0 - Create an account on GitHub**

You will need a GitHub account for all your projects.

**Step 1 - Create a Personal Access Token on Github**

To have access to your repositories and authenticate yourself, you need to create a Personal Access Token on Github.

**Step 2 - Update your profile on the Intranet (my Holberton School profil)**
Update your Intranet profile by adding your Github username

**Step 3 - Create your first repository**

Using the graphic interface on the github website, create your first repository.

* Name: Look at the bottom of the project to see the name of the repository
* Description: This is my first repository as a full-stack engineer
* Public repo
* No README, .gitignore, or license

**Step 4 - Open the sandbox**

On the intranet (Holberton School website), just under the task, click on the button and run to start the machine.

**Step 5 - Clone your repository**

On the webterm of the sandbox, do the following:

* Clone your repository

**Step 6 - Create the README.md and push the modifications**

* Navigate to this new directory.
* Create the file README.md with the content My first readme. 
* Add this new file to git, commit the change with this message "My first commit" and push to the remote server / origin

### **Task 1**
* **Repo-session**

Create a new directory called git in your repo.

Make sure you include a not empty README.md in your directory:

* at the root of your repository
* AND in the directory git

And important part: **Make sure your commit and push your code to Github - otherwise the Checker will always fail.**

For the next part, let's go the [Git directory](https://github.com/Aluranae/holbertonschool-zero_day/tree/main/git)
